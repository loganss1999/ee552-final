<h2>Governments</h2><hr size="1" width="100%" color="black"><p>Under U.S. constitutional law, the 50 individual states and the United States as a whole are each sovereign jurisdictions.<sup id="cite_ref-Radan,_2007,_p._12_16-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-Radan,_2007,_p._12-16">[16]</a></sup> The states are <i>not</i> administrative divisions of the country; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> allows states to exercise all powers of government not delegated to the federal government.
</p><p>Consequently, each of the 50 states reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way (within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Guarantee" class="mw-redirect" title="Republican Guarantee">Republican Guarantee</a> enforced by Congress) deemed appropriate by its people, and to exercise all powers of government not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> A state, unlike the federal government, has un-enumerated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_power_(United_States_constitutional_law)" title="Police power (United States constitutional law)">police power</a>, that is the right to generally make all necessary laws for the welfare of its people.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical.
<h3>Constitutions</h3><p>The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution. Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Alabama" title="Constitution of Alabama">Constitution of Alabama</a>, for example, contains 310,296 words – more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution.<sup id="cite_ref-S&amp;LG_19-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-S&amp;LG-19">[19]</a></sup> In practice, each state has adopted a three-branch frame of government: executive, legislative, and judicial (even though doing so has never been required).<sup id="cite_ref-S&amp;LG_19-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-S&amp;LG-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>Early on in American history, four state governments differentiated themselves from the others in their first constitutions by choosing to self-identify as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_(U.S._state)" title="Commonwealth (U.S. state)">Commonwealths</a> rather than as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">states</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>, in 1776;<sup id="cite_ref-Hornbook1994_21-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-Hornbook1994-21">[21]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, in 1777; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, in 1780; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, in 1792.

<h4>Executive</h4><p>In each state, the chief executive is called the governor, who serves as both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state" title="Head of state">head of state</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government" title="Head of government">head of government</a>. All governors are chosen by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_election" title="Direct election">direct election</a>. The governor may approve or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto" title="Veto">veto</a> bills passed by the state legislature, as well as recommend and work for the passage of bills, usually supported by their political party. In 44 states, governors have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-item_veto_in_the_United_States" title="Line-item veto in the United States">line item veto</a> power.<sup id="cite_ref-NCSLveto_23-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-NCSLveto-23">[23]</a></sup> Most states have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural_executive" class="mw-redirect" title="Plural executive">plural executive</a>, meaning that the governor is not the only government official in the state responsible for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)" title="Executive (government)">executive branch</a>. In these states, executive power is distributed amongst other officials,<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> elected by the people independently of the governor—such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_governor_(United_States)" title="Lieutenant governor (United States)">lieutenant governor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general" title="State attorney general">attorney general</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller#United_States" title="Comptroller">comptroller</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_(U.S._state_government)" class="mw-redirect" title="Secretary of State (U.S. state government)">secretary of state</a>, and others.
</p><p>The constitutions of 19 states allow for citizens to remove and replace an elected public official before the end of their term of office through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election" title="Recall election">recall election</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NCSLrecall_25-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-NCSLrecall-25">[25]</a></sup> Each state follows its own procedures for recall elections, and sets its own restrictions on how often, and how soon after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election" title="General election">general election</a>, they may be held. In all states, the legislatures can remove state executive branch officials, including governors, who have committed serious abuses of their power from office. The process of doing so includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment" title="Impeachment">impeachment</a> (the bringing of specific charges), and a trial, in which legislators act as a jury.<sup id="cite_ref-NCSLrecall_25-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-NCSLrecall-25">[25]</a></sup>
<h4>Legislative</h4><p>The primary responsibilities of state legislatures are to enact state laws and appropriate money for the administration of public policy.<sup id="cite_ref-NCSLveto_23-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-NCSLveto-23">[23]</a></sup> In all states, if the governor vetoes a bill (or a portion of one), it can still become law if the legislature overrides the veto (repasses the bill), which in most states requires a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote" title="Supermajority">two-thirds vote</a> in each chamber.<sup id="cite_ref-NCSLveto_23-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-NCSLveto-23">[23]</a></sup> In 49 of the 50 states the legislature consists of two chambers: a lower house (variously called the House of Representatives, State Assembly, General Assembly or House of Delegates) and a smaller upper house, in all states called the Senate. The exception is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameral" class="mw-redirect" title="Unicameral">unicameral</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Legislature" title="Nebraska Legislature">Nebraska Legislature</a>, which has only a single chamber.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> Most states have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-time_job" title="Part-time job">part-time</a> legislature (traditionally called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_legislature" title="Citizen legislature">citizen legislature</a>). Ten state legislatures are considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_job" title="Full-time job">full-time</a>; these bodies are more similar to the U.S. Congress than are the others.<sup id="cite_ref-NCSLftpt_27-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-NCSLftpt-27">[27]</a></sup>
</p><p>Members of each state's legislature are chosen by direct election. In <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_v._Carr" title="Baker v. Carr">Baker v. Carr</a></i> (1962) and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_v._Sims" title="Reynolds v. Sims">Reynolds v. Sims</a></i> (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court held that all states are required to elect their legislatures in such a way as to afford each citizen the same degree of representation (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_person,_one_vote" class="mw-redirect" title="One person, one vote">one person, one vote</a> standard). In practice, most states elect legislators from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-member_district" title="Single-member district">single-member districts</a>, each of which has approximately the same population. Some states, such as Maryland and Vermont, divide the state into single- and multi-member districts. In this case, multi-member districts must have proportionately larger populations, e.g., a district electing two representatives must have approximately twice the population of a district electing just one. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system" title="Electoral system">voting systems</a> used across the nation are: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post" class="mw-redirect" title="First-past-the-post">first-past-the-post</a> in single-member districts, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_non-transferable_vote" title="Multiple non-transferable vote">multiple non-transferable vote</a> in multi-member districts.
</p><p>In 2013, there were a total of 7,383 legislators in the 50 state legislative bodies. They earned from $0 annually (New Mexico) to $90,526 (California). There were various per diem and mileage compensation.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>
<h4>Judicial</h4><p>States can also organize their judicial systems differently from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_courts" class="mw-redirect" title="United States federal courts">federal judiciary</a>, as long as they protect the federal constitutional right of their citizens to procedural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process" title="Due process">due process</a>. Most have a trial-level court, generally called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_court" title="District court">District Court</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_court" title="Superior court">Superior Court</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Court" class="mw-redirect" title="Circuit Court">Circuit Court</a>, a first-level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeals" class="mw-redirect" title="Court of Appeals">appellate court</a>, generally called a Court of Appeal (or Appeals), and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_supreme_court" title="State supreme court">Supreme Court</a>. However, Oklahoma and Texas have separate highest courts for criminal appeals. In New York State, the trial court is called the Supreme Court; appeals go up first to the Supreme Court's Appellate Division, and from there to the Court of Appeals.
</p><p>State court systems exercise broad, plenary, and general jurisdiction, in contrast to the federal courts, which are courts of limited jurisdiction. The overwhelming majority of criminal and civil cases in the United States are heard in state courts. Each year, roughly 30 million new cases are filed in state courts and the total number of judges across all state courts is about 30,000—for comparison, 1 million new cases are filed each year in federal courts, which have about 1,700 judges.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>
</p><p>Most states base their legal system on English <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law" title="Common law">common law</a> (with substantial indigenous changes and incorporation of certain civil law innovations), with the notable exception of Louisiana, a former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_(New_France)" title="Louisiana (New France)">French colony</a>, which draws large parts of its legal system from French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a>.
</p><p>Only a few states choose to have the judges on the state's courts serve for life terms.

The Constitution delegates some powers to the national government, and it forbids some powers to the states. The Tenth Amendment reserves all other powers to the states, or to the people.

</p><p>Among the Article I enumerated powers of Congress is the power to regulate commerce. Since the early 20th century, the Supreme Court's interpretation of this "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause" title="Commerce Clause">Commerce Clause</a>" has, over time, greatly expanded the scope of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_power" class="mw-redirect" title="Federal power">federal power</a>, at the expense of powers formerly considered purely states' matters. The <i>Cambridge Economic History of the United States</i> says, "On the whole, especially after the mid-1880s, the Court construed the Commerce Clause in favor of increased federal power."<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> In 1941, the Supreme Court in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Darby_Lumber_Co." title="United States v.

Darby</a></i> upheld the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938" title="Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938">Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938</a>, holding that Congress had the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> Then, one year later, in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn" title="Wickard v. Filburn">Wickard v. Filburn</a></i>, the Court expanded federal power to regulate the economy by holding that federal authority under the commerce clause extends to activities which may appear to be local in nature but in reality effect the entire national economy and are therefore of national concern.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> For example, Congress can regulate railway traffic across state lines, but it may also regulate rail traffic solely within a state, based on the reality that intrastate traffic still affects interstate commerce. Through such decisions, argues law professor David F. Forte, "the Court turned the commerce power into the equivalent of a general regulatory power and undid the Framers' original structure of limited and delegated powers." Subsequently, Congress invoked the Commerce Clause to expand federal criminal legislation, as well as for social reforms such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964" title="Civil Rights Act of 1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>.

<h2>Admission into the Union</h2><hr size="1" width="100%" color="black"><p>Article IV also grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies" title="Thirteen Colonies">the original 13</a> to 50. Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.<sup id="cite_ref-EoS_34-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-EoS-34">[34]</a></sup> Article IV also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress. This caveat was designed to give Eastern states that still had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_cessions" title="State cessions">Western land claims</a> (including Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia), to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto" title="Veto">veto</a> over whether their western counties could become states,<sup id="cite_ref-4.3.1_33-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-4.3.1-33">[33]</a></sup> and has served this same function since, whenever a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_partition_proposals" title="List of U.S. state partition proposals">proposal to partition</a> an existing state or states in order that a region within might either join another state or to create a new state has come before Congress.
</p><p>Most of the states admitted to the Union after the original 13 were formed from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_incorporated_territories_of_the_United_States" class="mw-redirect" title="Organized incorporated territories of the United States">organized territory</a> established and governed by Congress in accord with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenary_power" title="Plenary power">plenary power</a> under Article IV, Section 3, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Four_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_2:_Property_Clause" title="Article Four of the United States Constitution">Clause 2</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> The outline for this process was established by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance" title="Northwest Ordinance">Northwest Ordinance</a> (1787), which predates the ratification of the Constitution. In some cases, an entire territory has become a state; in others some part of a territory has.
</p><p>When the people of a territory make their desire for statehood known to the federal government, Congress may pass an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_act" title="Enabling act">enabling act</a> authorizing the people of that territory to organize a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)" class="mw-redirect" title="Constitutional convention (political meeting)">constitutional convention</a> to write a state constitution as a step towards admission to the Union. Each act details the mechanism by which the territory will be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers. Although the use of an enabling act is a traditional historic practice, a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted. Upon acceptance of that constitution and meeting any additional Congressional stipulations, Congress has always admitted that territory as a state.
</p><p>In addition to the original 13, six subsequent states were never an organized territory of the federal government, or part of one, before being admitted to the Union. Three were set off from an already existing state, two entered the Union after having been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state" title="Sovereign state">sovereign states</a>, and one was established from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States#Formerly_unorganized_territories" title="Territories of the United States">unorganized territory</a>:
<p>Congress is under no obligation to admit states, even in those areas whose population expresses a desire for statehood. Such has been the case numerous times during the nation's history. In one instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_pioneers" title="Mormon pioneers">Mormon pioneers</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City" title="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</a> sought to establish the state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Deseret" title="State of Deseret">Deseret</a> in 1849. It existed for slightly over two years and was never approved by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a>. In another, leaders of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Civilized_Tribes" title="Five Civilized Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a> (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Territory" title="Indian Territory">Indian Territory</a> proposed to establish the state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Sequoyah" title="State of Sequoyah">Sequoyah</a> in 1905, as a means to retain control of their lands.<sup id="cite_ref-museum_63-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state#cite_note-museum-63">[63]</a></sup> The proposed constitution ultimately failed in the U.S. Congress. Instead, the Indian Territory and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Territory" title="Oklahoma Territory">Oklahoma Territory</a> were both incorporated into the new state of Oklahoma in 1907. The first instance occurred while the nation still operated under the Articles of Confederation. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Franklin" title="State of Franklin">State of Franklin</a> existed for several years, not long after the end of the American Revolution, but was never recognized by the Confederation Congress, which ultimately recognized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>'s claim of sovereignty over the area. The territory comprising Franklin later became part of the Southwest Territory, and ultimately of the state of Tennessee.
